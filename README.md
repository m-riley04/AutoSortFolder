# AutoSortFolder

## What
This is a program that I created entirely in Python during my free time that can take any unorganized folder and sort it with multiple sorting methods. Alphabetical, by date, by extension, and custom name parameters are included in v1.0, and more are expected to be added to future versions. Simply drag the .exe into whatever folder you want sorted, and open!

## Features (v1.0.0)
- 3 sorting methods
  - Alphabetical
  - Extension
  - Custom Keywords
- Completely customizable UI
- Auto-run avaliable
- Pause/resume automatic live-sorting
- Sorting desktop notifications

note: While I have taken a lot of my time making sure files are safe during sorting, I am NOT responsible for possible errors/corruption/overwriting that may occur during file sorting.
