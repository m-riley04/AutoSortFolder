# AutoSortFolder
This is a program that I created entirely in Python during my free time that can take any unorganized folder and sort it with multiple sorting methods.

# ==Development Update==
UPDATE (1/10/2024): Hello! It's been almost a year and a half or two since I touched this repository. That being said, I am planning on re-writing AutoSortFolder from scratch! This will be in either Python or C++, which has yet to be determined. For now, I will be updating the README to be much, much nicer.
