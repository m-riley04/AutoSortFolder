# AutoSortFolder
a python script that creates a folder that automatically sorts files you drag into it into their respective directories. 
note: While I have taken a lot of my time making sure files are safe during sorting, I am NOT responsible for possible errors/corruption/overwriting that may occur during file sorting.
